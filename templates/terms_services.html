                            merchant may have privacy and data collection practices that are diKerent from ours.
                            We have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. In addition, when

                            You release us and our aKiliates from any damages that you incur, and agree not to
                            assert any claims against us or them, arising from your purchase or use of any products

                            also agree not to make any purchases for speculative, false or fraudulent purposes or
                            for the purpose of anticipating demand for a particular product or service. You agree to
                            only purchase goods or services for yourself or for another person for whom you are

                            considered unauthorized, an infringing use of our copyrighted material, and may

                            If payment for a course is declined, our system will automatically disable access to our
                            premium materials. (We understand. This usually happens because a credit card
                            expires.) We want to help restore your access, so we’ll make every attempt to contact
                            you to help resolve this issue. Once the billing issue is resolved, we’ll restore access.

                            the most valuable you're a part of. Therefore, we reserve the right to remove anyone at any
                            time. While this is rare, we want to make it clear how seriously we take the integrity and
                            quality of our community.
