                            Non personal information is information that cannot identify you. If you visit this web

                            Yes, we may use cookies and related technologies, such as web beacons, to collect
                            information on our web site. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by
                            a
                            web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your
                            computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in
                            the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to
                            provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the
                            Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you register with
                            us, a cookie helps Your BestRecruiterAI to recall your specific information on
                            subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information,
                            such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same
                            Your BestRecruiterAI website, the information you previously provided can be
                            retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. A web beacon is a
                            small graphic image that allows the party that set the web beacon to monitor and
                            collect certain information about the viewer of the web page, web-based document or
                            e-mail message, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the IP address
                            of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was
                            viewed. Web beacons can be very small and invisible to the user, but, in general, any
                            electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail, including HTML based content,
                            can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to count visitors to the web pages
                            on the web site or to monitor how our users navigate the web site, and we may include
                            web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count how many messages sent were
                            actually opened, acted upon or forwarded.
